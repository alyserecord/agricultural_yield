# The dataset
The dataset used for this analysis came from the Food and Argricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The FAO's Crops dataset consists of area harvested (ha), production (tons), and yield (hg/ha) data for 173 crops broken out by country and years 1961-2017. 

# What crops have had the most consistent yield increase global? 

By using the crop yield data, I calculated the yeild change rate year over year for the global yeild average of each crop.

For example here is the yield rate of change for Avocados globally:

By analyzing the crop yield data, I identified crops where the yeild rate change was greater than a given threshold for the greatest number of years. Olive, Pistachios, Quinoa, Hempseed, and Cloves are all crops that had a 5% or greater yeild change rate for 20 or more years between 1961 and 2017. Of those, I began to notice that even though they had a large number of years that the Yeild rate change was significant, it was largely due to the irradic year over year yield. 

For example, even though Olives yeild did increase by more than 5% for more than 20 years, it was spread across many years when the yield had dropped in previous years.

One crop that did stand out was Cloves, which did not seem to drop between yeild rate increases on average.
